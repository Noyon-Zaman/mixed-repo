    <h3>At a time when almost all of the local banks in Bangladesh are grappling with higher non-performing loans (NPLs), most foreign lenders have been able to keep the default rate in check.</h3></p><br>

    <h3>The average NPL ratio of nine foreign banks was 4.91 per cent in 2022, according to the Bangladesh Bank data.<img src="bangla nature.jpg"><br>

        For the state-run banks, the average NPL ratio was 20.28 per cent and for the specialised banks, it was 12.8 per cent. The NPL averaged 5.13 per cent for the private commercial banks.</h3></p><br>

The team may have suffered sour defeats before but after recent records established them as a high-flying ODI side, they have now stumbled at home with a series defeat and the team morale has taken a hit.
